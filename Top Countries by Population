1.What are average, max, and min values in the data?

SELECT AVG(population) FROM countries;

SELECT name, max(population) FROM countries;

SELECT name, min(population) FROM countries;

SELECT MAX(percent_of_world_pop) FROM countries;

SELECT MAX(fertility_rate), name FROM countries;

SELECT MIN(fertility_rate), name FROM countries;

SELECT MIN(median_age) FROM countries;

2. What countries have a population over the 2,000,000?

SELECT name, AVG(population) AS Avg_population FROM countries GROUP BY name HAVING Avg_population > 2000000;

3.Categorize countries with fertility rate by color.

SELECT name, 
    CASE
        WHEN fertility_rate > 10 THEN "GREEN"
        WHEN fertility_rate > 8 THEN "YELLOW"
        WHEN fertility_rate > 3 THEN "ORANGE"
        ELSE "RED"
    END AS fertility_status
FROM countries;

4. Find the countries that has between 10,000 sq km and 200,000.

SELECT name, area_sq_km FROM countries WHERE area_sq_km >10000 AND area_sq_km < 200000;

5. What are the fertility rates of countries with a population greater than 2 million and a net migration rate greater than 60,000?

SELECT name, fertility_rate FROM countries WHERE population_change > 2 or net_migrants > 60000;
